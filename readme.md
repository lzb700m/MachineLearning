Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation
=====================================

This repository includes the implementation of machine learning algorithms (Classification, Clustering, Ensemble Method) learnt in Professor Nicholas Ruozzi's Machine Learning Class (http://www.utdallas.edu/~nrr150130/cs6375/2015fa/index.html).

The following algorithms have been implemented:
-- Gradient Descent (Matlab)
-- Coordinate Descent (Java)
-- Support Vector Machine (Matlab)
-- Decision Tree (Java)
-- Naive Bayes (Java)
-- Logistic Regression (Java)
-- Bayesian Network Structure Learning - Chowliu Tree(Java)
-- Bayesian Network Parameter Learning (Java)
-- Adaboost (Java)
-- Value iteration for Markov Decision Process (Java)
-- Spectral Clustering (Matlab)

All the Java code are organized in packages, training and testing samples are in ./data folder. A driver class is provided for each algorithm implemented, it is called "*Test.java". To test an algorithm, run:

	javac src/package_name/*Test.java
	java bin//package_name/*Test
from the command line.
